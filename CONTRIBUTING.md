Problems Running or Installing QMix
-----------------------------------

If you have any problems getting QMix to work, first read through the [installation instructions](https://garrettj403.github.io/QMix/setup.html#installing-qmix-using-pip) online and then make sure you are using the [virtual environment](https://garrettj403.github.io/QMix/setup.html#configuring-python) (``QMix/environment.yml``) that I included with QMix.

If you are still having problems, please email me at garrettj403@gmail.com. I can also help you setup your simulations.
