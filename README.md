# QMix

*Multi-Tone Spectral Domain Analysis of Quasiparticle Tunnelling in SIS Mixers*

QMix is a software package that consists of modules and scripts to simulate SIS mixer operation. See the ``workflow-examples`` directory for examples on how to use this software or [John Garrett's thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:d47fbf3b-1cf3-4e58-be97-767b9893066e) for examples on how this software has been applied to analyze experimental data.
