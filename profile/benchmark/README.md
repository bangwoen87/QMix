Speed Tests
===========

This directory has two different scripts that can be used to time how long it takes QMix to:

- calculate the quasiparticle tunneling currents (``time-qtcurrent.py``)
- perform the harmonic balance procedure (``time-harmonic-balance.py``)

The results can then be plotted by:

    python plot-results.py results-qtcurrent.txt
    python plot-results.py results-harmonic-balance.txt
