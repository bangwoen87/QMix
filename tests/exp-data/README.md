Example Experimental Data
=========================

This directory contains example experimental data that can be used to test the ``QMix`` package. This data was taken from a 230 GHz SIS mixer (Garrett, 2018). Do not use this data for anything else besides testing the ``QMix`` package.

These files include:
   - ``dciv-data.csv``: measured I-V data with no LO present
   - ``dcif-data.csv``: measured IF power with no LO present
   - ``f230_0_iv.csv``: measured I-V data with LO pumping at 230 GHz
   - ``f230_0_if-hot.csv``: measured IF output power from a hot black body load (room temperature Eccosorb) at 230 GHz
   - ``f230_0_if-cold.csv``: measured IF output data from a hot black body load (Eccosorb immersed in liquid nitrogen) at 230 GHz
