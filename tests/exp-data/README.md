Example Experimental Data
=========================

This directory contains example experimental data that can be used to test the ``QMix`` package. This data was taken from a 230 GHz SIS mixer (see my thesis). Do not use this data for anything else besides testing the ``QMix`` package.

This includes:
   1. ``dciv-data.csv``: measured DC I-V data (no LO)
   2. ``dcif-data.csv``: measured IF power (no LO)
   3. ``f230_0_iv.csv``: measured pumped I-V curve at 230 GHz
   4. ``f230_0_if-hot.csv``: measured IF output power from a hot black body load at 230 GHz
   5. ``f230_0_if-cold.csv``: measured IF output data from a hot black body load at 230 GHz
