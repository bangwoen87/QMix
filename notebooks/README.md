Example Workflows
=================

This directory contains 3 example workflows:
   1. ``single-tone-simple.ipynb``: a simple one tone simulation of an SIS junction
   2. ``multi-tone.ipynb``: a multi-tone simulation (heterodyne mixing) of an SIS junction
   3. ``analyze-experimental-data.ipynb``: analyzing experimental data from an SIS mixer

This directory contains some example experimental data, which is used to run these examples. This data is contained within ``eg-230-data/``.
