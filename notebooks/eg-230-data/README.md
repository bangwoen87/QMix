Example Experimental Data
=========================

This directory contains example experimental data that can be used for running the example workflows. This data was taken from a 230 GHz SIS mixer (Garrett, 2018). Do not use this data for anything else besides testing the workflows.

These files include:
   - ``dciv.csv``: DC I-V data (with no LO pumping)
   - ``dcif.csv``: DC IF power data (with no LO pumping)
   - ``f230.2_iv.csv``: pumped I-V curve at 230.2 GHz
   - ``f230.2_if-hot.csv``: IF output data from hot load at 230.2 GHz
   - ``f230.2_if-cold.csv``: IF output data from cold load at 230.2 GHz
