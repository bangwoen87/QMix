Speed Tests
===========

This directory has two different scripts that can be used to time how long it takes QMix to:

- calculate the quasiparticle tunneling currents (``time-qtcurrent.py``), and 
- perform a full harmonic balance procedure (``time-harmonic-balance.py``).

Each script will run the test with 1, 2, 3 and 4 tones. The results are contained within ``results-qtcurrent.txt`` and ``results-harmonic-balance.txt``. The results can then be plotted using ``plot-results.py``.
