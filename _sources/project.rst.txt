The QMix Package
================

*What can you do with QMix?*

The QMix package allows you to simulate the dc and ac quasiparticle tunnelling currents in an SIS junction.

Unlike SuperMix:

   1. QMix can analyze higher-order harmonics

      - QMix uses spectral domain analysis for all of the tones and harmonics. The junction's operation is never linearized, which allows higher-order harmonics to be simulated faithfully.

   2. QMix can handle multiple strong tones

      - QMix doesn't split the simulation into large-signal and small-signal analysis. Instead, all of the tones are treated in the same manner.

   3. QMix is written in Python

      - Python is 

         - Interpreted: no need to compile
         - Portable: easy to run on a variety of operating systems and machines
         - High-level: fewer lines of code required than C/C++.

      - Python also has an extensive online community with many different packages available for a variety of needs. Notably:

         - NumPy: linear algebra and other numerical tools. Built upon BLAS and LAPACK, which makes it very fast.
         - MatplotLib: extensive plotting tools.
         - Scikit-rf: microwave engineering tools including importing touchstone files, plotting Smith charts, and cascading S-matrices.

   4. QMix is open-source (or will be soon)

      - QMix is hosted on GitHub. Having it open source will allow QMix to grow and develop new features as they are needed.
