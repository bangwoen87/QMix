Getting Started
===============

Installing QMix
---------------

QMix is hosted on `GitHub`_. To clone the repository, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory in which you would like to put QMix, and then run:

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix/

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix.git QMix

This will download QMix into a new directory called ``QMix/``. You then need to add the QMix directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. If you are on a macOS system, first navigate into ``QMix/`` directory and then run:

.. code-block:: bash

   . install.sh

This will apppend the QMix directory to your ``.bash_profile``, which will then tell Python where to find QMix in the future.

Configuring Python
------------------

QMix is written in Python 3. If you don't want to change your Python installation or in case you are missing any packages, I have included a virtual environment with all the packages that are required to run QMix. Assuming that you are using the Anaconda package manager, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f environment.yml

This may take a few minutes. You can then activate the virtual environment using:

.. code-block:: bash

   source activate qmix

Once activated, you should be able to run all of the scripts contained in QMix.
