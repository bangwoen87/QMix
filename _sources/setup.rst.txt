Getting Started
===============

Installing QMix
---------------

You can either download or clone the QMix repository from `GitHub`_. To clone the repository, use:



.. _GitHub: https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix/

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix.git

.. warning::

   The QMix package is currently private. You can still get private access if you email me (john.garrett@astro.ox.ac.uk), but access is currently limited to those in my research group.

You then need to add the QMix directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. On macOS, this is done by adding the following to your ``.bash_profile``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/qmix:$PYTHONPATH

Running a simulation
--------------------

Each simulation consists of 5 basic steps:

   1. Define the embedding circuit: list all frequencies/harmonics and their corresponding voltages and impedances

      - an instance of the ``qmix.circuit.EmbeddingCircuit`` class

   2. Define the response function: provide or generate the dc I-V curve to characterize the junction

      - an instance of the ``qmix.respfn.RespFn`` class

   3. Perform harmonic balance to solve for the junction voltage at each frequency/harmonic/bias voltage

      - using the ``qmix.harmonic_balance.harmonic_balance`` function

   4. Calculate the tunnelling currents at whatever frequencies that you like

      - using the ``qmix.qtcurrent.qtcurrent`` function

   5. Plot your results

The easiest way to learn how to use these classes/functions is to take a look at the examples provided in ``workflow-examples``. Simple 1 tone simulations are included in ``workflow-examples/single-tone-simulations/`` and more complex heterodyne mixing simulations are included in ``workflow-examples/multi-tone-simulations/``.

Remember that you can always use ``pydoc`` to figure out how to use these functions/classes as well. For example, if you don't know what arguments ``qtcurrent`` takes, you can type ``pydoc qmix.qtcurrent.qtcurrent`` into the terminal to list the help page.
