Getting Started
===============

Installing QMix
---------------

You can either download or clone the QMix repository from `GitHub`_. To clone the repository, use:

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix/

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix.git

You then need to add the QMix directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. On macOS, this is done by adding the following to your ``.bash_profile``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/qmix:$PYTHONPATH

Configuring Python
------------------

I have included a file in the root directory to setup a virtual environment. Assuming that you are using Anaconda, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f environment.yml

You can then activate the virtual environment using:

.. code-block:: bash

   source activate qmix
