*Multi-Tone Spectral Domain Analysis of Quasiparticle Tunnelling in SIS Mixers*

QMix is a software package that consists of modules and scripts to simulate SIS mixer operation. Please take a look at John Garrett's `thesis`_ (Chapter 4) for examples on how this software has been applied to analyze experimental data.
