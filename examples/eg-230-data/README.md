Example Experimental Data
=========================

This directory contains example experimental data that can be used for running the example workflows. This data was taken from a 230 GHz SIS mixer (see my thesis). Do not use this data for anything else besides testing the workflows.

This includes:
   1. ``dciv.csv``: DC I-V data
   2. ``dcif.csv``: DC IF data
   3. ``f230.2_iv.csv``: pumped I-V curve at 230.2 GHz
   4. ``f230.2_if-hot.csv``: IF output data with hot load at 230.2 GHz
   5. ``f230.2_if-cold.csv``: IF output data with cold load at 230.2 GHz
